At rightmost 45% and bottom a pale oak craft table holds a generous arrangement of cream, mist blue, oatmeal, pale sage skeins and cakes, one small knit sample and a crochet hook. One tall light wooden yarn shelving unit near extreme right. Keep top14% quiet cream for navigation. Viewer feels inside a calm airy handcrafted cottage.

NO text, typography, logos, UI, buttons, frames, watermarks, cats or animals. Full scene to image edges.
