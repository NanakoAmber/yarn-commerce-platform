# Impeccable

Design and review the requested surface within the approved product scope and visual direction. For this yarn project, read `docs/agents/visual-review.md` for image language, Comp-first approval and finish evidence; root `AGENTS.md` owns data and production boundaries.

## Start and select a workflow

1. Run `<skill-base-dir>/scripts/impeccable context` once per session, keeping cwd at the project. The loaded skill base resolves command paths in this skill and its references; `.github/skills/impeccable` is the fallback. Pass `--target <path>` for a known route or source file. The launcher uses its bundled binary or downloads it on first run.
2. Load only the reference for the requested command below. New surfaces or replacement visual worlds use [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md). Inspect the target and current visual evidence before editing; missing `DESIGN.md` alone does not imply a new design.
3. Immediately before UI edits, read [craft-floor.md](reference/craft-floor.md). Planning-only work does not need it.

Follow the user's approved brief. Refinement preserves identity, behavior, factual copy and everything outside scope; replacement redesign preserves product truth and function while replacing the visual world. Do not invent claims. Reuse existing approval for the same direction and scope.

Choose a surface mode from visitor intent: **Persuade** (decide and act), **Operate** (complete a task), **Read** (understand), or **Experience** (view the work itself). Record it in the surface brief only; [operate.md](reference/operate.md) adds Operate / Read guidance when relevant.

Batch desktop and mobile self-QA, fix the observed defects together, then confirm. Stop polishing once required checks pass. A failed check remains unresolved until fixed or reported; a self-QA limit never waives required finish review or permits a false completion claim.

## Routing and maintenance

- Explicit or clearly implied command: use that reference. Resolve ordinary overlap from scope; ask only when the choice changes the user's intended result.
- Bare `/impeccable` with no task: read [routing.md](reference/routing.md) and show its suggestions. A concrete design request should proceed through the matching workflow, not stop at a menu.
- General design: new surface / replacement → [new-work.md](reference/new-work.md); missing `PRODUCT.md` in that workflow → [init.md](reference/init.md). Narrow refinement proceeds from incumbent evidence as `context` directs.
- `teach` aliases `init`; `craft` is a deprecated new-work alias. `shape` discovers UX scope, then enters new-work for visual direction decisions. Resume after init without rerunning `context`.
- `pin <pin|unpin> <command>` manages standalone command shortcuts. Run through the skill launcher and report its result; preserve error stderr.
- `hooks <on|off|status|ignore-rule|ignore-file|ignore-value|reset>`: read [hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) when requested.
- `doctor`: read [doctor.md](reference/doctor.md) when asked to inspect or repair stale Impeccable artifacts. Report `CONTEXT_STALE` during unrelated tasks; do not repair it unless requested, except fields marked `auto` updated by the next normal write.
